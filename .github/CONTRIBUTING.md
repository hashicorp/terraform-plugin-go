# Contributing to terraform-plugin-go

**First:** if you're unsure or afraid of _anything_, just ask
or submit the issue describing the problem you're aiming to solve.

Any bug fix or feature has to be considered in the context of the wider
Terraform ecosystem. This is great, as your contribution can have a big
positive impact, but we have to assess potential negative impact too (e.g.
breaking existing providers which may not use a new feature).

To provide some safety to the wider provider ecosystem, we strictly follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and any changes that we consider
breaking changes will only be released as part of major releases. **Note:**
while we're on v0, breaking changes will be accepted during minor releases.

## I want to report a vulnerability

Please disclose security vulnerabilities responsibly by following the procedure
described at https://www.hashicorp.com/security#vulnerability-reporting

## New Issue

We welcome issues of all kinds, including feature requests, bug reports, or
documentation suggestions. Below are guidelines for well-formed issues of each
type.

### Bug Reports

 - [ ] **Test against latest release**: Make sure you test against the latest
   avaiable version of both Terraform and terraform-plugin-go. It is possible
   we already fixed the bug you're experiencing.

 - [ ] **Search for duplicates**: It's helpful to keep bug reports consolidated
   to one thread, so do a quick search on existing bug reports to check if
   anybody else has reported the same thing. You can scope searches by the
   label `bug` to help narrow things down.

 - [ ] **Include steps to reproduce**: Provide steps to reproduce the issue,
   along with code examples (both HCL and Go, where applicable) and/or real
   code, so we can try to reproduce it. Without this, it makes it much harder
   (sometimes impossible) to fix the issue.

### Feature Requests

 - [ ] **Search for possible duplicate requests**: It's helpful to keep
   requests consolidated to one thread, so do a quick search on existing
   requests to check if anybody else has requested the same thing. You can
   scope searches by the label `enhancement` to help narrow things down.

 - [ ] **Include a use case description**: In addition to describing the
   behavior of the feature you'd like to see added, it's helpful to also lay
   out the reason why the feature would be important and how it would benefit
   the wider Terraform ecosystem. A use case in the context of 1 provider is
   good, a use case in the context of many providers is better.

### Documentation Suggestions

 - [ ] **Search for possible duplicate suggestions**: It's helpful to keep
   suggestions consolidated to one thread, so do a quick search on existing
   issues to check if anybody else has suggested the same thing. You can scope
   searches by the label `documentation` to help narrow things down.

 - [ ] **Describe the questions you're hoping the documentation will answer**:
   It's very helpful when writing documentation to have specific questions like
   "what is required of the response to ApplyResourceChange?" in mind. This
   helps us ensure the documentation is targeted, specific, and framed in a
   useful way.

## New Pull Request

Thank you for contributing!

We are happy to review pull requests without associated issues, but we highly
recommend starting by describing and discussing your problem or feature and
attaching use cases to an issue first before raising a pull request.

- [ ] **Early validation of idea and implementation plan**: terraform-plugin-go
  is complicated enough that there are often several ways to implement
  something, each of which has different implications and tradeoffs. Working
  through a plan of attack with the team before you dive into implementation
  will help ensure that you're working in the right direction.

- [ ] **Unit Tests**: It may go without saying, but every new patch should be
  covered by tests wherever possible.

- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Not all tests are appropriate to surface as unit
  tests. We use
  [`terraform-provider-corner`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-corner)
  to gather use cases that get run as part of our test suite. These real-world
  test cases are run by an actual Terraform binary and help us verify that
  end-to-end behavior as observed by users is retained. We encourage
  contributors to add test cases to `terraform-provider-corner` when
  contributing new features or submitting bug fixes. We love to see links to
  `terraform-provider-corner` PRs from `terraform-plugin-go` PRs.

- [ ] **Go Modules**: We use [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to manage and version all our dependencies. Please make sure that you reflect dependency changes in your pull requests appropriately (e.g. `go get`, `go mod tidy` or other commands). Refer to the [dependency updates](#dependency-updates) section for more information about how this project maintains existing dependencies.

- [ ] **Changelog**: Refer to the [changelog](#changelog) section for more information about how to create changelog entries.

### Cosmetic changes, code formatting, and typos

In general we do not accept PRs containing only the following changes:

 - Correcting spelling or typos
 - Code formatting, including whitespace
 - Other cosmetic changes that do not affect functionality
 
While we appreciate the effort that goes into preparing PRs, there is always a
tradeoff between benefit and cost. The costs involved in accepting such
contributions include the time taken for thorough review, the noise created in
the git history, and the increased number of GitHub notifications that
maintainers must attend to.

#### Exceptions

We belive that one should "leave the campsite cleaner than you found it", so
you are welcome to clean up cosmetic issues in the neighbourhood when
submitting a patch that makes functional changes or fixes.

### Dependency Updates

Dependency management is performed by [dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/about-dependabot-version-updates). Where possible, dependency updates should occur through that system to ensure all Go module files are appropriately updated and to prevent duplicated effort of concurrent update submissions. Once available, updates are expected to be verified and merged to prevent latent technical debt.

### Changelog

HashiCorpâ€™s open-source projects have always maintained user-friendly, readable CHANGELOGs that allow practitioners and developers to tell at a glance whether a release should have any effect on them, and to gauge the risk of an upgrade. We use the [go-changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-changelog) to generate and update the changelog from files created in the `.changelog/` directory.

#### Changelog Format

The changelog format requires an entry in the following format, where HEADER corresponds to the changelog category, and the entry is the changelog entry itself. The entry should be included in a file in the `.changelog` directory with the naming convention `{PR-NUMBER}.txt`. For example, to create a changelog entry for pull request 1234, there should be a file named `.changelog/1234.txt`.

``````markdown
```release-note:{HEADER}
{ENTRY}
```
``````

If a pull request should contain multiple changelog entries, then multiple blocks can be added to the same changelog file. For example:

``````markdown
```release-note:note
tfprotov6: The `Old()` function has been deprecated. Any code using `Old()` should be updated to use the new `New()` function instead.
```

```release-note:enhancement
tfprotov6: Added `New()` function, which does new and exciting things
```
``````

#### Pull Request Types to CHANGELOG

The CHANGELOG is intended to show developer-impacting changes to the codebase for a particular version. If every change or commit to the code resulted in an entry, the CHANGELOG would become less useful for developers. The lists below are general guidelines and examples for when a decision needs to be made to decide whether a change should have an entry.

##### Changes that should not have a CHANGELOG entry

- Documentation updates
- Testing updates
- Code refactoring

##### Changes that may have a CHANGELOG entry

- Dependency updates: If the update contains relevant bug fixes or enhancements that affect developers, those should be called out.

##### Changes that should have a CHANGELOG entry

###### Major Features

A major feature entry should use the `release-note:feature` header.

``````markdown
```release-note:feature
Added `great` package, which solves all the problems
```
``````

###### Bug Fixes

A new bug entry should use the `release-note:bug` header and have a prefix indicating the sub-package it corresponds to, a colon, then followed by a brief summary. Use a `all` prefix should the fix apply to all sub-packages.

``````markdown
```release-note:bug
tfprotov6: Prevented potential panic in `Example()` function
```
``````

###### Enhancements

A new enhancement entry should use the `release-note:enhancement` header and have a prefix indicating the sub-package it corresponds to, a colon, then followed by a brief summary. Use a `all` prefix for enchancements that apply to all sub-packages.

``````markdown
```release-note:enhancement
tfprotov6: Added `Great` interface for doing great things
```
``````

###### Deprecations

A deprecation entry should use the `release-note:note` header and have a prefix indicating the sub-package it corresponds to, a colon, then followed by a brief summary. Use a `all` prefix for changes that apply to all sub-packages.

``````markdown
```release-note:note
tfprotov6: The `Old()` function is being deprecated in favor of the `New()` function
```
``````

###### Breaking Changes and Removals

A breaking-change entry should use the `release-note:breaking-change` header and have a prefix indicating the sub-package it corresponds to, a colon, then followed by a brief summary. Use a `all` prefix for changes that apply to all sub-packages.

``````markdown
```release-note:breaking-change
tfprotov6: The `Example` type `Old` field has been removed since it is not necessary
```
``````

## Testing

Code contributions should be supported by unit tests wherever possible.

### Unit tests

This codebase follows Go conventions for unit testing. Some guidelines include:

- **File Naming**: Test files should be named `*_test.go` and usually reside in the same package as the code being tested.
- **Test Naming**: Test functions must include the `Test` prefix and should be named after the function or method under test. An `Example()` function test should be named `TestExample`. A `Data` type `Example()` method test should be named `TestDataExample`.
- **Concurrency**: Where possible, unit tests should be able to run concurrently and include a call to [`t.Parallel()`](https://pkg.go.dev/testing#T.Parallel). Usage of mutable shared data, such as environment variables or global variables that are used with reads and writes, is strongly discouraged.
- **Table Driven**: Where possible, unit tests should be written using the [table driven testing](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests) style.
- **go-cmp**: Where possible, comparison testing should be done via [`go-cmp`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/go-cmp). In particular, the [`cmp.Diff()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp#Diff) and [`cmp.Equal()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp#Equal) functions are helpful.

A common template for implementing unit tests is:

```go
func TestExample(t *testing.T) {
    t.Parallel()
    testCases := map[string]struct{
        // fields to store inputs and expectations
    }{
        "test-description": {
            // fields from above
        },
    }
    for name, testCase := range testCases {
        // Do not omit this next line
        name, testCase := name, testCase
        t.Run(name, func(t *testing.T) {
            t.Parallel()
            // Implement test referencing testCase fields
        })
    }
}
```

## Maintainers Guide

This section is dedicated to the maintainers of this project.

### Releases

Before running a release, the changelog must be constructed from unreleased entries in the `.changelog` directory.

Install the latest version of the [`changelog-build`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/go-changelog/cmd/changelog-build) command, if it not already available:

```shell
go install github.com/hashicorp/go-changelog/cmd/changelog-build
```

Run the [`changelog-build`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/go-changelog/cmd/changelog-build) command from the root directory of the repository:

```shell
changelog-build -changelog-template .changelog.tmpl -entries-dir .changelog -last-release $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0) -note-template .changelog-note.tmpl -this-release HEAD
```

This will generate a section of Markdown text for the next release. Open the `CHANGELOG.md` file, add a `# X.Y.Z (Unreleased)` header as the first line, then add the output from the `changelog-build` command. The `(Unreleased)` suffix after the version number is required for the current release process.

Refer to the HashiCorp internal Engineering documentation for information about completing the release process once the changelog has been prepared.
