# terraform-plugin-go

terraform-plugin-go provides low-level Go bindings for the Terraform
plugin protocol, for integrations to be built upon. It strives to be a
minimal possible abstraction on top of the protocol, only hiding the
implementation details of the protocol while leaving its semantics
unchanged.

## Status

This project is experimental right now. It should not be relied upon in
production.
