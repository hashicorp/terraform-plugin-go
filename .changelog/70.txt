```release-note:breaking-change
The `tftypes` package has been moved to the root of the module and is no longer under the `tfprotov5` package. Providers can automatically rewrite their import paths using a command like `sed -i 's/"github.com\/hashicorp\/terraform-plugin-go\/tfprotov5\/tftypes"/"github.com\/hashicorp\/terraform-plugin-go\/tftypes"/g' **/*.go` on Unix-like systems.
```
