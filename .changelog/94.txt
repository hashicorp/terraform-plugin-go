```release-note:breaking-change
tftypes: The `Is()` method on types implementing the `Type` interface now only perform a shallow type check, no longer comparing any underlying attribute or element type(s). Use the `Equal()` method for deep type checking.
```

```release-note:breaking-change
tftypes: Types implementing the `Type` interface must now implement the `Equal()` and `UsableAs()` methods.
```

```release-note:enhancement
tftypes: All types implementing the `Type` interface now provide an `Equal()` method for deep type checking and `UsableAs()` method for type conformance checking.
```
