```release-note:breaking-change
tfprotov6: The `SchemaObject.MaxItems` and `SchemaObject.MinItems` fields have been removed without replacement. These were never used in the protocol and did not perform any validation.
```

```release-note:bug
tfprotov6: The `ApplyResourceChangeResponse.UnsafeToUseLegacyTypeSystem` and `PlanResourceChangeResponse.UnsafeToUseLegacyTypeSystem` fields are now properly passed into and out of the protocol
```
