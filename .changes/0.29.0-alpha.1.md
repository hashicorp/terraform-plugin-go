## 0.29.0-alpha.1 (July 08, 2025)

NOTES:

* This alpha pre-release contains the protocol definitions and Go type definitions for list resources, which are a new type of resource. ([#512](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-go/issues/512))
* A `ProviderServerWithListResource` can be used with the `terraform query` subcommand in Terraform 1.13.0-alpha20250708 and later to search unmanaged infrastructure. ([#512](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-go/issues/512))
* The list resource protocol definitions are considered experimental and may change up until general availability. ([#512](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-go/issues/512))
* tfprotov5+tfprotov6: An upcoming release will require the `ValidateListResourceConfig` and `ListResource` implementations as part of `ProviderServer`. ([#514](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-go/issues/514))
